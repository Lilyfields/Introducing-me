 ### Hello
#### My pen name is Lillian Rosie Garden. 
#### However, please call me Lily.
 
## Biography
 
 My journey as a web developer starts here. As a student, studying full stack web development through the Sydney University Coding Boot camp.
 The initial stage has been a very challenging experience. Given I have no prior knowledge or experience as a web developer. 
 Jumping into the deep end, I was lucky support was at hand to help me learn and see the possibilities.
 
 ## Motivation
 
 My motivation to continue with web development came from seeing the possibilities and the great work I can help people accomplish. The desire to create and be creative makes web development more appealing. The challenges of completing a project or task within a short time frame; is so familiar and common in my daily role at work. That I am so immune, and honestly can say feels so rewarding when completed; because I know 100% effort was put in.
 
 ## Email Address
